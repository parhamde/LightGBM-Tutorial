# LightGBM-Tutorial
In this project, I will discuss one of the most successful ML algorithm LightGBM Classifier. LightGBM is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. It has helped Kagglers win data science competitions. 


So, let's get started.
